/**
 * A module is a unit of "content" that can be published to a
 * server.
 * <p>
 * All modules have a module type, which is fixed for the
 * lifetime of the module. The set of module types (or
 * "kinds") is open-ended.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All modules are created by module factories
 * ({@link org.eclipse.wst.server.core.IModuleFactory}).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The content of a module is a collection of file and folder
 * resources in the workspace.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In principle, a module exists independent of any
 * particular server. The same module instance can be associated
 * with multiple server instances at the same time. That is
 * why you cannot ask the module which server it's associated
 * with.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * [issue: IModule is something that is exposed to normal 
 * clients; it should move to org.eclipse.wst.server.core package.]
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * [issue: See issues on IModuleType about why it should not
 * be a superinterface of IModule.]
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * [issue: Equality/identify for modules?]
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Concrete module types are represented by concrete classes
 * implementing this interface. The only legitimate reason
 * to declare a subclass is to implement a module factory.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <it>Caveat: The server core API is still in an early form, and is
 * likely to change significantly before the initial release.</it>
